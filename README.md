# DairyPlantProject

Goal: To put together a dataset for regression analysis and estimate the inputs that would be needed to operate a dairy processor in Nebraska. Once we are able to estimate some hypothetical scenarios from the dataset, Dr. Thompson and Dr. Dennis will run all of the collected data (not all of the data is in this repo) through IMPLAN and determine the possible economic impacts of opening a dairy processor.

Files on this repo:

- `DairyPlantProject.R` : Scraper that scrapes the dairy food organizations data from the website
- `helpers.R` : helper function that help extract the links just to make things easier for when extracting data in chunks using `maps()` function from `purrr` package

Project Status: Complete
